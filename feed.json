My cofounder Hua has a <a href=\"https://typogram.co/font-discovery/\" title=\"more in-depth newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more in-depth newsletter</a> about font discovery and how to use them for branding and marketing. In her writing, she covers why certain typefaces are suitable for specific types of brands.</p>\n<p>We have summarized a few criteria that we are looking for when classifying typefaces based on brand personalities:</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Visual Characteristics</h2>\n<p>If you find typefaces all look kind of similar to each other, sometimes “identical,” you are not alone. Typefaces are supposed to be that way so that they can be easily recognized as the alphabet. </p>\n<p>Fun story, a friend of mine was pulled over by traffic police once. The police asked what her job was, and she said she is a type designer; with the police still confused, she further explained that she designs letters. The police were even more confused and asked, “what do you mean you design letters? All the letters are already designed.”</p>\n<p>The police got a point, the overall shapes of the alphabet are established, but there are still endless ways to render them. Type designers’ job is to explore endless possibilities, construct systematic styles to render the alphabet, and package them into typefaces. Each typeface has unique visual characteristics that differentiate them from the others; think of it as their “font market fit.” </p>\n<p>The visual characteristics that I am looking at includes:</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><figure class=\"sizing-normal\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png 1456w\" alt=\"\" width=\"526\" height=\"484\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1272f3f-13f8-4598-bf58-6879b7bc7f45_526x484.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:484,&quot;width&quot;:526,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:31336,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure></picture></div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>From these characteristics, I can connect the lines like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Handwriting font expresses casualness while serif fonts look formal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Heavyweight font conveys sturdiness and firmness, while lightweight font conveys elegance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Taller x-height fonts look friendlier, while shorter x-height fonts look higher class and maybe even a little snobby about it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Historical Background</h2>\n<p>The historical background of a typeface style also informs their personality. Garamond, a typeface designed in the 15th century, carries legacy and heritage. Therefore it is suitable for universities, law firms, financial institutions, and companies identified with “Classic” brand personality. If you want to learn more about Garamond, Hua wrote <a href=\"https://typogram.co/font-discovery/how-to-use-eb-garamond-font\" title=\"typogram fontdiscovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an article about it</a>.</p>\n<p>The historical background factor is very intertwined with the visual characteristics factor; we may associate certain personalities to visual characteristics because of when the visual styles were invented. Foods for thoughts today: if Serif font was created in the 20th century and Sans Serif in the 15th, will we have different views on them? Would “Sans Serif” conveys classy and heritage, and “Serif” conveys modern and freshness? Let me know in the comments what you think!</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Cultural Context and Trends</h2>\n<p>How the typeface has been used in pop culture also influences what personality we associate them with. For example, the Didot typeface, with its signature high stroke contrast, is used by fashion magazines Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue.

I need to adopt “a global mindset,” which I wrote about in <a href=\"https://wentin.substack.com/p/40103611\" rel=\"\">Learn by Practice: 3 Lessons from ProductHunt Launch</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">What I learned from reading other’s newsletters:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-reference your content.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After accumulated some content, I can link-reference my previous posts. It will make my writing leaner since I don’t need to repeat the content. It also helps to drive traffic to older posts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Make valuable content that is worthy of the reader’s time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This seems obvious. But for the build-in-public type of newsletter, it is tempting just to document daily work to keep it raw. I find it more healthy of a relationship to provide value worthy of readers’ time, maybe by summarizing learning or sharing advice related to that day’s work.</p>",

As a self-taught coder with limited training, I am not the fastest to learn a new coding framework. When choosing a tech stack, I could be a peculiar case, compared to tech cofounders with a traditional computer science background. However, with more and more self-taught coders joining our community, I think sharing my experience and thinking could be of help.</span></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Storytime! I chose Angular.js over React.js for a project when the former was already deprecated. I know, I know! Angular.js was the transformative framework that upgraded my coding stills from “add limited logic to a static website” to “make an entire web app.” I was proud that I leveled up with Angular.js, but at the same time, I saw Angular.js fell out of fashion to competitors rapidly.</p>\n<p>When I challenged myself to make a web app to house my CSS ICON project, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to learn React.js because the project scope was simple: I needed a template to display icons from an array repeatedly, and a search bar to filter icons. When clicking on each icon, a sidebar would appear and show the detailed code. I knew on top of my head how to implement it with Angular.js! Should it be that hard to implement in React.js? I heard they were very similar.</p>\n<div><hr></div>\n<p>It turned out to be painful three days of pulling my hair out, and still unable to implement even the most basic feature. On day three, I finally gave up and went back to Angular.js and finished the project on the same day. </p>\n<p>You may wonder what happened to the project. Did I ever go back and rewrite the app? I haven’t touched the codebase for five years. The project is <a href=\"https://cssicon.space/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">still running</a> and brings me side income to this very day. Choosing a deprecated framework saved me time and agony and made me money. The seemingly terrible tech stack decision didn’t come back to bite me years later. It turned out, Angular.js was perfect for the job! Because of these reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It can do the job</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Even though deprecated, Angular.js already had all the features I needed for the app. I was not relying on getting any future updates to the framework. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I already know how to use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“I already know” is better than “I must learn.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dev time is shorter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Launch sooner so I can “fail fast, fail often.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also accepted the possibility that I might have to rewrite the code later on. The possibility that “the idea doesn’t work, pivot to different ideas” is greater than “the idea works, but I am stuck with a terrible tech stack and need to rewrite the code.” The idea may fail for other reasons, and the “quick but dirty” tech stack empowers me to invalidate the idea sooner to move on to the right idea.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular opinions, I think there is no need for startups to worry about scalability at the early stages. If the idea works, there will be time and resources to fix the tech stack.U</p>\n<p>Update on my growth hack project from <a href=\"https://typogram.co/build/thinking-about-saas-growth-hacking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yesterday</a>: I chose Webflow as my tech stack because it is faster to build and iterate. Check out my progress here: https://promo-modal.webflow.io/. Let me know what you think of the prototype or my decision to use Webflow by replying to the newsletter. What is your opinion on choosing a tech stack for startups? I am eager to learn other perspectives! </p>",

It got me worried. </span></div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Marketing on Twitter, IndieHackers, and HackerNews helped a little, but it also brought down my productivity; hence yesterday’s newsletter subject “<a href=\"https://wentin.substack.com/p/fighting-unproductiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fighting Unproductivities</a>.” I need to brainstorm new strategies to growth-hack. I started by listing my unique advantages and disadvantages. </p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Disadvantage</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Low Twitter engagement</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have 3,700 followers, accumulated over five years via passion projects – I launched each project with a link to my Twitter profile. However, I rarely tweeted; my tweet count is lower than some accounts with three months of history. I failed to create engaging tweets to keep followers interested. Now I have suddenly become actively promoting my content on Twitter, but the engagement is low. </p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> I should not growth-hack on Twitter. Instead, I should create original non-self-promo tweets to get back on track first.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Advantage</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I own a few popular sites</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing I did right over the years was passion projects. I have a few project sites with consistent visitor streams. </p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> maybe some of the visitors could be interested in my recent work? I can add a modal to these sites that lead visitors to my latest work.</p>\n<p>I took a look at google analytics to see which site is the most popular. The most popular sites that I own are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cssicon.space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cssicon.space</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"play.typedetail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play.typedetail.com</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://typedetail.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">typedetail.com</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I started to design the modal pop-up interaction. My favorite place to get inspiration for interactive animation is <a href=\"http://tympanus.net/codrops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Codrops</a>.

            "content_html": "<p>Last week was eventful and, based on one’s stock portfolio, painful. Over the years that I worked at Adobe, I bought into the <a href=\"https://g.co/kgs/uzvnbm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ADBE</a> stock through labor (RSU) and money (ESPP). A big portion of my net worth is held in ADBE stock, and that stock sunk 20% on a single day — the day they announced Adobe would acquire Figma for $20 billion. </p>\n<p>This newsletter series started on Aug 2nd, 2021, days after I left my position at the Adobe. Prior to founding <a href=\"https://typogram.co/\">Typogram</a>, I spent a year and a half working on <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe XD</a> and five years on another Adobe acquisition Typekit (now called <a href=\"https://fonts.adobe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe Fonts</a>). I felt the blow on multiple levels. One that I was once devoted to Adobe XD, spending days and nights trying to win the battle with Figma, but now the acquisition announces Adobe XD’s premature defeat. One that I mentioned earlier — the blow in my wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">$20 billion is four times over-priced</h2>\n<p>Let’s begin with the wallet blow. Not every investor of ADBE stock is like me, who held a grudge because they worked on the internal competitor product. Why do other investors hate the acquisition, as shown by the stock price plunge? The simple answer is that the $20 billion price tag is too expensive.</p>\n<p>Startup evaluation is complex, but there are shortcuts we can take to do a rough estimate. We can try to estimate in two different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Figma last raised funds at a valuation of $10 billion in June 2021. At first glance, it might make sense: Figma is doing so well that it doubled its valuation in a year of time between 2021 and 2022. Except 2021 is at the peak of startup valuation, most startups cut their valuation by a lot in 2022, including those doing well. Taking Canva, another contender in the design space, for example, its valuation declined from $40 billion in 2021 to $26 billion in 2022, despite that they are doing well. Apply the same ratio to Figma, the Figma 2022 valuation is estimated to be <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another way to peek at a startup’s valuation is by revenue and growth multiplier. High-growth startups may have a high multiplier like 10x. Figma is targeted to hit $400 million in revenue, assuming it has already hit the target revenue, multiple by a high multiplier of 10x — its valuation is at <strong>$4 billion</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the actual value of Figma is around <strong>$5 billion</strong>. $20 billion would be four times overpriced; hence investors dropped the stock on the heel of the acquisition announcement. Nobody likes a bad deal. To reach such a deal, it must be Adobe begged to acquire Figma; it was not a level field negotiation. Why does Adobe need Figma so badly?</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Organization chart oddity</h2>\n<p>Reading Figma’s CEO’s <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a> announcement, after the acquisition, he will report to David Wadhwani, not Scott Belsky, which stands out as odd to me. Scott Belsky is the person in charge of Creative Cloud. You may see him in every Adobe Max keynote talking about Creative Cloud products. After the acquisition announcement, the “design Twitter” jokingly mocked up Figma’s app icon in Creative Cloud form — it was transparent to everyone that Figma would be part of Creative Cloud; then why does the Figma CEO not report to the head of Creative Cloud?</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e1ff16-07b9-4384-9c05-550563b1c66a_1587x1080.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe\"><figcaption>Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The answer, I now speculate as an outsider, is that David Wadhwani is the one who led and pushed through the acquisition, not Scott Belsky; therefore, the new Figma org reports to him. </p>\n<p>Adobe has invested heavily in Adobe XD, <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/10/05/introducing-project-comet-a-new-tool-for-designing-and-prototyping-user-experiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first announced to public as Project Comet in Oct 2015, 7 years ago</a>. While it is surely not as popular as Figma, it is nothing less than a successful product, strengthening the Creative Cloud ecosystem. According to the <a href=\"https://uxtools.co/survey-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2021 design tools survey</a> (the latest, 2022 survey has yet to come out), Adobe XD is the 3rd most popular UI design tool and 2nd most popular UI prototyping tool. Compared to <a href=\"https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#ui-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 design tools survey</a>, Adobe XD is on the rise — it jumped from 3rd to 2nd place in UI prototyping category and shortened the gap between itself and 2nd place in the UI design category:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09679d21-7de2-48fc-b234-7a72678f6d89_1778x604.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co\"><figcaption>Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As a user, we may view products as 1 or 0 — if I don’t use it, it almost doesn’t exist. But the market is vast and diverse; you might be surprised how many companies are using Adobe XD over Figma. All this is to say: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adobe XD is a considerable investment; Adobe has worked on it for more than seven years; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adobe XD is rising, not failing</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Figma not reporting to the head of Creative Cloud sends a bad signal to me, almost a red flag. Did a group of business people decide to buy Figma without any serious consideration of Adobe XD’s effort? Have the “decision makers” ever even opened Adobe XD before they come to the conclusion that Adobe must have Figma for $20 billion? For Adobe to either admit XD’s defeat and have Figma annex XD, or strategize upon having two similar products grow side by side, it should most certainly involve the team who spent 7+ years building Adobe’s equivalence of Figma. It would be ignorant not to consult with them and have a thorough analysis of what Adobe XD is lacking in comparison to Figma and how difficult is it to build the missing parts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Conflict of interest</h2>\n<p>Who is David Wadhwani, the person Figma is going to report to? I have never heard of this name while working at Adobe. A little further research shows he joined Adobe in June 2021, just over a year ago. His last position prior was Venture Partner at venture capital firm <a href=\"https://greylock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greylock</a>. In his <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwadhwani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dwadhwani\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter </a>profile, he is still a partner at Greylock; unknown to me whether it is outdated information due to lack of updates. Greylock invested in Figma in Series A, B, C, D, and E! Figma Series A’s price was $0.2 per share; it 200x’ed at the acquisition deal. I think there is a conflict of interest for David to lead the acquisition of Figma in Adobe, if David is still working for Greylock or if he has personally invested in Figma. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ce0542d-1ea7-4b52-ba47-d24250b16e61_1377x668.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Figma’s funding history\"><figcaption>Figma’s funding history</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For context, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/elon-musk-wins-shareholder-lawsuit-over-the-companys-2point6-billion-solarcity-acquisition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elon Musk got sued by shareholders</a> in a similar situation.

Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: expected revenues, cost savings, synergies and other benefits from the proposed transaction, such as <strong>Adobe’s ability to enhance Creative Cloud by adding Figma’s collaboration-first product design capabilities and the effectiveness of Figma’s technology, might not be realized within the expected time frames or at all</strong> and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I painfully laugh at this disclaimer, for how true it might be. I think the best outcome for users is for Figma to remain largely the same. But even with Adobe keeping Figma as independent as it can be, it will develop and grow at a much slower pace since there will be no venture capital funds pouring in, and Adobe’s resources drained to pay off the acquisition cost. The only winner is Figma investors. This acquisition is a lose-lose-lose situation for Adobe, Figma, and the design community. </p>\n<p>With accelerated stock vesting triggered by the acquisition, a lot of Figma employees will jump ship to their next adventure. It is hard to blame them — they are rich now, so why not become angel investors or found their own company? That is the bright side of this acquisition — more competition is always better. Figma helped Adobe XD become better, and vice versa: “<a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-advanced-animations-with-smart-animate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smart Animate</a>” came from Adobe XD to Figma; “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JaQBWSB88w&amp;ab_channel=AdobeCreativeCloud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Live Co-editing</a>” came from Figma to Adobe XD (Ah Yes, Adobe XD supports multi-player mode for three years now). I await to see what the design tool experts from Figma will bring to the world next.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">❧</h2>\n<p>Did you know that we also have a build in public newsletter?

It turned out to be only half true. I find flow only happens with crafty activities, such as designing, coding, or writing. It never happens when I do self-promotion or marketing. Furthermore, on the days that I did both types of activities, I can’t get into the flow at all. In an attempt to fight my unproductiveness, I start to self-diagnose why.</p>\n<p>To enter the state of flow, it needs a few hours of ramping up. The concentration level climbs up and then stays in the flow state at its peak, maintains it for a while, and then cools down.

These new challenges become the new productivity killer.</p>\n<p>I think it may help to dedicate days to marketing/self-promotion solely. If I have some extra time on those days, I can relax and browse the Internet to find inspirations or do market research. These activities seem to go together because they have similar attention patterns. On other days, I dedicate all day to design/code/write.</p>\n<p>Do you have more tips on fighting unproductiveness?

It is a day in history for apparent reasons, though I am here to document and summarize what happened in my small startup life. We launched our first product on </span><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brand-personality-workshop-kit\" rel=\"\" style=\"font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Product Hunt</a><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">! There is a lot of learning that I can share with you from the launch.</span></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">How does Product Hunt work?</h4>\n<p>Product hunt operates on a 24-hour interval. The clock resets at 00:00 pacific time (3 am in New York, where I live). All launched products during the 24 hours will show up under the Newest tab. The highest-voted product will show up in the Popular tab, which is the default tab that brings massive traffic. A note-worthy rule is that every product shares the same 24-hour interval. If your product is launched at 23:59 pacific time, it only has 1 minute of exposure.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Lesson 1: Launch with a global mindset.</h4>\n<p>My original idea was to launch in the morning. I assumed people that I can reach is in a similar timezone as I am. I should promote during my daytime when my audience is active on Twitter or checking their Emails. Launching at 3 am is very counter-intuitive for me. I honestly forget the 3 am in New York would be 9 am somewhere else in the world. I should have had a global mindset when I planned for launch. The cryptocurrency market never closes, so is launching a product.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Lesson 2: Product Hunt is not a great place to get paying customers.</h4>\n<p>While producthunt can brings traffic, it doesn’t convert to paying customers. Its visitors are not in the shopping mindset. They are in a discovery or research mindset. While I had sales through producthunt, it all came from direct audiences of my cofounder’s or mine. It didn’t help that my product was the only two that require payment on that day. The majority of launched products are free or offers a free tier. It is better to offer a free option and use producthunt as a channel to get exposure rather than paying customers.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Lesson 3: Product Hunt weighs “authentic” upvotes more than friends and family votes.</h4>\n<p>Our product got 34 upvotes in total but didn’t get to the popular tab, while products with fewer votes did. I think that is due to the ranking algorithm. Votes from accounts with a long history are weighed more, while votes from freshly-opened accounts are weighed less or even penalized. If you are planning a producthunt launch, I suggest reaching out to a few producthunt users with a long history and securing their vote upfront to get your product on the Popular tab.</p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">❧</h4>\n<div id=\"§\" class=\"header-anchor-widget offset-top\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I think this is a good learning experience. I was very fearful to launch on producthunt before because I was overthinking it. This experience debunks many misperceptions about launching on producthunt and gives me some ideas of how to run a successful launch. I need to learn by practicing, be it making sales or launching a product on an unfamiliar platform.</p>\n<p>Thanks for tuning in!

Launching a product could take forever. The perfectionist may get the better of you. Instead of MVP, before you know it, you are choosing the perfect tech stack, executing the perfect feature set, grinding the perfect UI/UX, refactoring to write the perfect code. Why? Because anything less is not good enough to represent you, not good enough to have your name signed to it. Your pride gets the better of you.</p>\n<p>Secondly, you need to have a definition of failure to fail fast. I did many passion projects before, and there is no definition of failure for a passion project. Getting a Twitter follower is a win for me; having 100 site visitors is a win for me. It is impossible to fail a passion project. The root problem is that you are not asking much in return for your effort. Taking to step forward to “ask” is difficult because you may fail and get rejected, especially to ask for money. Your pride gets the better of you, again.</p>\n<p>I launched a product today! I used Notion as a #NoCode tool to develop the minimum viable feature set. Notion is not the perfect tech stack, but it offers many advantages, such as built-in live collaborations.</p>\n<p>I charge money for it! It is priced at $10. I am running a sale with a coupon code “limitedsale” to offer $9 off for a limited time.</p>\n<p>It is my first time selling. I want to see what works and what doesn’t. One thing I know for sure: designing helped me get better at design; selling will help me get at making sales! I want to sell and learn as much as possible in the process.

            "content_html": "<p>This morning I woke up to some Gumroad emails that I made several sales from the <a href=\"https://wentin.gumroad.com/l/brand-workshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand personality workshop kit</a>. It gives me tremendous encouragement. Two-thirds of the sales came from the newsletter readers, you! I can’t say how much I appreciate it; it means a lot to me, thank you!</p>\n<p>That gives me a significant mental shift. I have made money via my passion projects, primarily by publishing ads on my sites, but never by charging for the project itself. It gives me confirmation that this route could work. I need to work harder, finding more pain points and good solutions to address them, and that is all!</p>\n<p>A few of my readers have written to me expressing they will be joining me on a similar path. I want to share a few quotes that clicked with me while I was making the hard decisions. Maybe they can bring you courage too, and make the decision less scary.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You are not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of the business—to gain your financial freedom.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote clicked with me at “renting out your time.” It is not the prettiest way to describe employment, but there is some truth to it. I think passion plays a significant role in this: if employment is the only way to do the work you are passionate about, then forget about the whole renting out your time thing. You would spend the time doing it nevertheless. But if you have itches that are outside of your work, and you would prefer to spend time on them even when not being paid, then maybe the phrase will start to hit you the same way it hit me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you don’t build your dreams, then someone else will hire you to build theirs.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote clicked with me at “building someone else’s dream.” I think working in big corporate, the dreamer often is too rich that I wouldn’t care to help build their dream, like Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos thanked all Amazon employees for paying for his outer space ride. Exactly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fact: There are three types of income: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>earned income (e.g., W2 salary)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>business income (e.g., startup company)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>investment income (e.g., stocks)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Earned income is the most taxed income in the United States (and maybe elsewhere too). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This fact is why wealthy people pay fewer taxes; they have little to no earned income. It shocked me when I first learned this, and I started sharing it with people around me. It turned out that most people didn’t know that either. I don’t think it is fair, but what can I do other than diversify my income to the other two types?</p>\n<p>If you are thinking about quitting your full-time job and would like to share your story, feel free to chat with me by replying to the newsletter, I am all ears! Thanks for tuning in!</p>",

When I kicked off today’s work, I started by looking at marketing design examples. A few trends I noticed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Colorful, highly saturated colors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incorporate photography or 3D objects</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, I discovered that a prettified version of a real-life scene is more marketable than a pure 2D digital style. That made sense! In a digital product marketplace, everything is digital inherently; digital style doesn’t draw attention anymore. I see a lot of people are calling back the old-school “software in a box” to their digital product marketing, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><figure class=\"sizing-normal\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png 1456w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1456\" height=\"850\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88f61f5b-6e42-4fef-bc0b-c78224b745c4_2010x1173.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:850,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1239108,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure></picture>\n<div class=\"image-link-expand\"> </div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>I teach design at the School of Visual Arts in New York. In one of my classes, I tell students always to be aware of trends, to serve two purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>avoid the trend when needed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>follow the trend when needed</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today is one of the situations that I have decided to follow the trend. I am designing to please the eyes of site visitors. No, there is no shame in that! Design is to solve a problem. Today the problem is how do I grab people’s attention in a busy marketplace, so they would stop and look at what I am offering. The solution I found is “Design to Please.”</p>\n<p>Designers should develop their styles, and I do have a style preference, shown in the work I linked in the first paragraph. But it doesn’t hurt to do something else when the problem needs me to. It was an enjoyable break from the style I am familiar with.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I got some great tips and advice! Thank you! Let me know what you think of the graphics I designed by replying to the email. Is there any way I can improve them before launching the product page? Is it clear that I am selling a brand personality workshop kit in the form of printable PDF and Notion templates?</p>",
