<p>Today is my 20th-day building my startup in public through this newsletter series. Over this condensed timeframe that I practiced the “build-in-public” concept, I grew new understandings of its whys and hows.</p>
<p>Build-in-public, in its essence, is creating a new relationship between founder and audience. In the traditional way of running a startup, the founder-audience relationship doesn’t start until the product launches. Build-in-public helps the relationship happen earlier during the development phase. It provides more room for the relationship to grow, engage and create value.</p>
<p>In healthy relationships, everyone both gives and receives. </p>
<p><strong>Founders receive: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>early product feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engagement and support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be held accountable, momentum</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Founders should not take these three gifts for granted. Most build-in-public newsletters are free but don’t adopt that “free” mindset. Readers are paying attention and time, which are the most valuable. I feel grateful to have a growing group of people who checked out my progress daily. They propel me to show up the next day because “if I don’t, someone will notice.” It is healthy accountability to have.</p>
<p><strong>Founders should give:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Summarized learnings from successful and failed experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insight into product design, development, and marketing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparent stats that can benefit others</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In my opinion, the build-in-public experiments would only succeed if founders can also create values for their audiences in return. If it is just a work log, it may not work that well. Founders should put into thoughts how to make it worthwhile for the audience’s time. I am still exploring how to create meaningful content for you. Let me know what you want to see in the future.</p>
<p>In the past 20 issues of the newsletter, there are a few issues I struggled to write. There are two scenarios when that happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I went into an extended flow state. It would be 11:30 pm when I wrapped up work, and I still had a newsletter to write. Yesterday, when I posted <a href="https://typogram.co/build/typeface-finder-app-demo/">Typeface Finder App Demo</a> at 3 am, was one of the cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I spent the day slacking off and had nothing to write about by the end of the day. <a href="https://typogram.co/build/fighting-unproductiveness-in-startup-life/">Fighting Unproductiveness</a> on Day 12 was one of the cases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I would wish #1 happens more frequently, but truth be told, #2 is much more likely to occur in my case. I have accepted both versions of me, the flow state me and the slacking off me, and learned to tackle two different problems with an equal mind. Both were difficult, but both had payoffs:</p>
<p>In the #1 scenario, sticking to the plan and writing the newsletter, even at very late hours, helped me clear my head and the path forward. The writing exercise gave me the space to think about the bigger picture after being knee-deep in the nitty-gritty of craftmanship all day. On a side note, it also forced me to create marketable content such as screenshots or screencasts, which come in handy later. </p>
<p>In the #2 scenario, I was forced to write about any topic, even unproductiveness itself. It created a space for me to self-reflect and do a thought exercise. Even when it failed at every level, the ritual of delivering the newsletter gave me a feeling of accomplishment: even though I didn’t do anything that day, at least I wrote a newsletter. It is mental trickery that I needed to keep momentum instead of dwelling into an unproductive spiral. With a single accomplishment bagged that day, I can see tomorrow as a fresh start.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to write to me about what you would like to see in the following issues. Or let me know what drives you to subscribe in the beginning. Your advice and insights are very valuable to me. Thanks for tuning in, and have a wonderful weekend!</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Retool is a low-code platform that requires coding to use, making the initial learning curve a little steep. Once I get the hang of it, I am yearning to make more apps with my newly acquired skills. Retool is created for internal tools, but there is no stop sign to making public apps with it. An idea came to me: <strong>making a web app to help users find typefaces based on brand personalities.</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to list all brand personalities in our database. <a href="https://twitter.com/HuaTweets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hua</a> and I spent days narrowing down personality adjectives to this final list:</p>

<p>How the app work is simple: user select brand personalities that fit their company, the app shows a list of typefaces tagged with these brand personalities. </p>
<p>To demo the app, I will use the brand personalities of <a href="https://inverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inverr</a>, a no-code website builder created by <a href="https://twitter.com/hieuSSR/status/1430363788432142341" rel="">Hieu Nguyen</a>. Hieu is very kind to support us along our journey; he purchased our <a href="https://typogram.co/build/brand-personality-workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand personality workshop kit</a> and did the workshop for his company’s brand. These are the five adjectives that came out of his workshop: Affordable, Friendly, Modern, Secure, and Simple; I select them from the list in the left column, the middle column starts to get populated with typefaces shown in live specimen.</p>
<p>The brand personality typefaces sometimes belong to bigger font families with many other weights and styles. It would be helpful for users to access these sibling fonts, so I build an additional feature: when users select a typeface in the middle column, the right column will show all family members of that selected typeface. </p>

<p>All of our tagged typefaces have free-for-commercial-use licenses. Hua made sure of it by checking every typeface’s license; thanks, Hua, for the hard work! That means I can provide more app features like the download fonts button and web font embed code. These features are still under development, as well as refining the app. <a href="https://typogram.co/build/entrepreneurs-last-mile-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The last mile</a> of the project is the most crucial; I am well-prepared to see it through! I will share more about this project in the newsletter.</p>
<p>Let me know what pain points you have when choosing typefaces or what other features I should add to this app by replying to the email. I can’t wait to hear your ideas. </p>

<p class="post-title unpublished"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">The uprising of the NoCode and LowCode movement is not caused by people’s resistance to learning code, but the opposite. Product development is getting democratized. It is no longer under the monopoly of bigger companies; a small team or a solo entrepreneur can develop an app and sell it directly to customers. It unlocks creativity, productivity, and new lifestyle options.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="available-content">
<div class="body markup" dir="auto">
<p>At first, it was the coders who quitted their jobs and pursued this lifestyle because modern coding frameworks made it possible to develop an app with just one coder. Then we see more people joining, non-coders with product ideas, they venture out to learn to code themselves and find alternative solutions to make their vision coming to life. That is the starting point of NoCode platforms.</p>
<p>NoCode platform is not replacing coding; it created an entirely new market: many products that would never be developed in the traditional way now have a chance to see the light of day. These are apps serving a small number of users that would not be economical to hand code. Without NoCode, it is not that these users’ problems aren’t solvable; these problems are simply not worthy of solving. Seeing people suffering and wasting time is a shame.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://typogram.co/build/brand-personality-workshop/">brand workshop kit</a> that I made with Notion - I wouldn’t make it if I couldn’t find a way to do it with NoCode. It is solving too niche of a problem. In the banking and finance industry, there is “too big to fail”; in product making, there was “too small to exist.” However, that is being changed by NoCode platforms! Despite the brand personality workshop kit being a niche need, I would want it to exist. I am thankful that the NoCode platform helped me make it happen.</p>
<p>When comparing the NoCode and LowCode, I enjoy LowCode platforms more because they allow me to add custom code. It doesn’t need to have a fully-featured code editor embedded inside the app; even a cumbersome code editing experience like a &lt;textarea&gt; field will do. It just needs to have custom code ability so that I can have the creative freedom to build whatever I want while utilizing the NoCode features.</p>
<p>On the other end, I think traditional tooling can use a dash of code as well! After Effects expression can be seen as an early example of this.</p>

<p>Perhaps Adobe XD and Figma can add code capability, such as allowing property value to be a dynamic formula, making it more versatile and creative:</p>

<p>Last week, I shared a growth hack idea and the start of the execution in Day 13th’s newsletter <a href="https://typogram.co/build/thinking-about-saas-growth-hacking/">A Day in the Life of a Growth Hacker</a>. It was a quick and fun exploration. I spent <a href="https://typogram.co/build/an-unorthodox-way-to-choose-tech-stack/">the following day developing it</a>. The remaining work is adding it into three sites that I owned. I estimated it to be a trivial part of the following day’s work, but it turned out to be false.</p>
<p>There are two types of people: starter and finisher. Starters live for the creative beginning of projects; finishers enjoy accomplishing the day-to-day work and following through. I am a starter type. My first hurdle of crossing the finishing line is procrastination. I hate to get into the nitty-gritty of the fit and finish work. I am more tempted to start a new project in the meantime.</p>
<p>Today I finally get into the work I was procrastinating on. I realize there are a lot of details to attend to, even for a small growth hack project.</p>
<p>The first thing is to make the promotion modal responsive, something I omitted initially:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabaeb170-e22f-4f96-afc2-5b8ee928660e_1398x908.gif" data-is-external-image="true"  width="1247" height="986"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I added it to the first candidate site: <a href="https://cssicon.space/" rel="">cssicon.space</a>. CSS Icon is the sample site I used to create the template, so everything naturally fits together :</p>

<p>As much as I tried to architect the code in anticipation of these customizations, a few surprises showed up here and there and took a few more rounds to finalize! This is only a simple pop-up modal; the last-mile problem will only be more significant for a full product!</p>
<p>Today’s lesson: be prepared for the last-mile problem when making a product. The last leg of the journey can be the slowest and most expensive. Leave enough time and space to grind on the fit and finish.</p>

<p>The process of curating typefaces that express each brand’s personality is the meat of the work. My cofounder Hua has a <a href="https://typogram.co/font-discovery/" title="more in-depth newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more in-depth newsletter</a> about font discovery and how to use them for branding and marketing. In her writing, she covers why certain typefaces are suitable for specific types of brands.</p>
<p>We have summarized a few criteria that we are looking for when classifying typefaces based on brand personalities:</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Visual Characteristics</h2>
<p>If you find typefaces all look kind of similar to each other, sometimes “identical,” you are not alone. Typefaces are supposed to be that way so that they can be easily recognized as the alphabet. </p>
<p>Fun story, a friend of mine was pulled over by traffic police once. The police asked what her job was, and she said she is a type designer; with the police still confused, she further explained that she designs letters. The police were even more confused and asked, “what do you mean you design letters? All the letters are already designed.”</p>
<p>The police got a point, the overall shapes of the alphabet are established, but there are still endless ways to render them. Type designers’ job is to explore endless possibilities, construct systematic styles to render the alphabet, and package them into typefaces. Each typeface has unique visual characteristics that differentiate them from the others; think of it as their “font market fit.” </p>
<p>The visual characteristics that I am looking at includes:</p>

<p>From these characteristics, I can connect the lines like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Handwriting font expresses casualness while serif fonts look formal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heavyweight font conveys sturdiness and firmness, while lightweight font conveys elegance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taller x-height fonts look friendlier, while shorter x-height fonts look higher class and maybe even a little snobby about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Historical Background</h2>
<p>The historical background of a typeface style also informs their personality. Garamond, a typeface designed in the 15th century, carries legacy and heritage. Therefore it is suitable for universities, law firms, financial institutions, and companies identified with “Classic” brand personality. If you want to learn more about Garamond, Hua wrote <a href="https://typogram.co/font-discovery/how-to-use-eb-garamond-font" title="typogram fontdiscovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an article about it</a>.</p>
<p>The historical background factor is very intertwined with the visual characteristics factor; we may associate certain personalities to visual characteristics because of when the visual styles were invented. Foods for thoughts today: if Serif font was created in the 20th century and Sans Serif in the 15th, will we have different views on them? Would “Sans Serif” conveys classy and heritage, and “Serif” conveys modern and freshness? Let me know in the comments what you think!</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Cultural Context and Trends</h2>
<p>How the typeface has been used in pop culture also influences what personality we associate them with. For example, the Didot typeface, with its signature high stroke contrast, is used by fashion magazines Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue. We started to associate its style with fashion. </p>

<p>With that cultural context influencing a generation of designers and consumers, many fashion brands use the Didot style typeface for their branding. For example:</p>

<p>Pop culture is not static; it has a rhythm of change, which we refer to as the trend. When cultural context shifts, the brand personalities of a certain typeface will also change, unlike the historical background factor, which tends to be more stable. We already see the fashion industry start shifting to Sans Serif typefaces, and one day we may stop associating Didot typeface with Fashionable.</p>

<p>I think #1 applies to many other fields as well. Overnight success does happen, but nobody can count on it. The majority of success stories are made by consistently showing up day after day. Consistently being good will make you great. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open-rate will naturally drop when subscriber count climbs up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson was passed on to me by my co-founder, who has been running newsletters for six months. Knowing open-rate will drop naturally set up my expectation correctly, so I am not worrisome when it happens. Be warned: it is easy to be kidnapped by the stats.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">What I learned from the process of running my newsletters:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t correlate the number of new signups with the quality of your writing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of your overall writing is essential and will affect your growth in the long term. However, it is not equally valid at the micro-level. If I had fewer new signups after the last newsletter, it doesn’t necessarily mean that newsletter is terrible. This is the open rate and new signups for each newsletter:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no best time in the day to send a newsletter</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought there would be a prime time to send and tried to test what time works the best. First off, the test didn’t yield any sensible conclusion since I can’t control the parameters: each newsletter has a different title/subject; therefore, I can’t compare their open rates apple to apple. I also find the concept of the best time in the day is false because not all my subscribers are in the same time zone. I need to adopt “a global mindset,” which I wrote about in <a href="https://wentin.substack.com/p/40103611" rel="">Learn by Practice: 3 Lessons from ProductHunt Launch</a>.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">What I learned from reading other’s newsletters:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cross-reference your content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After accumulated some content, I can link-reference my previous posts. It will make my writing leaner since I don’t need to repeat the content. It also helps to drive traffic to older posts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make valuable content that is worthy of the reader’s time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems obvious. But for the build-in-public type of newsletter, it is tempting just to document daily work to keep it raw. I find it more healthy of a relationship to provide value worthy of readers’ time, maybe by summarizing learning or sharing advice related to that day’s work.</p>

<div class="image2-inset">
<div class="image-link-expand"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">I am a designer who can code and the technical cofounder of my startup. As a self-taught coder with limited training, I am not the fastest to learn a new coding framework. When choosing a tech stack, I could be a peculiar case, compared to tech cofounders with a traditional computer science background. However, with more and more self-taught coders joining our community, I think sharing my experience and thinking could be of help.</span></div>
</div>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Storytime! I chose Angular.js over React.js for a project when the former was already deprecated. I know, I know! Angular.js was the transformative framework that upgraded my coding stills from “add limited logic to a static website” to “make an entire web app.” I was proud that I leveled up with Angular.js, but at the same time, I saw Angular.js fell out of fashion to competitors rapidly.</p>
<p>When I challenged myself to make a web app to house my CSS ICON project, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to learn React.js because the project scope was simple: I needed a template to display icons from an array repeatedly, and a search bar to filter icons. When clicking on each icon, a sidebar would appear and show the detailed code. I knew on top of my head how to implement it with Angular.js! Should it be that hard to implement in React.js? I heard they were very similar.</p>
<div><hr></div>
<p>It turned out to be painful three days of pulling my hair out, and still unable to implement even the most basic feature. On day three, I finally gave up and went back to Angular.js and finished the project on the same day. </p>
<p>You may wonder what happened to the project. Did I ever go back and rewrite the app? I haven’t touched the codebase for five years. The project is <a href="https://cssicon.space/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still running</a> and brings me side income to this very day. Choosing a deprecated framework saved me time and agony and made me money. The seemingly terrible tech stack decision didn’t come back to bite me years later. It turned out, Angular.js was perfect for the job! Because of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can do the job</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Even though deprecated, Angular.js already had all the features I needed for the app. I was not relying on getting any future updates to the framework. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I already know how to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“I already know” is better than “I must learn.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dev time is shorter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launch sooner so I can “fail fast, fail often.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also accepted the possibility that I might have to rewrite the code later on. The possibility that “the idea doesn’t work, pivot to different ideas” is greater than “the idea works, but I am stuck with a terrible tech stack and need to rewrite the code.” The idea may fail for other reasons, and the “quick but dirty” tech stack empowers me to invalidate the idea sooner to move on to the right idea.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular opinions, I think there is no need for startups to worry about scalability at the early stages. If the idea works, there will be time and resources to fix the tech stack.U</p>
<p>Update on my growth hack project from <a href="https://typogram.co/build/thinking-about-saas-growth-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yesterday</a>: I chose Webflow as my tech stack because it is faster to build and iterate. Check out my progress here: https://promo-modal.webflow.io/. Let me know what you think of the prototype or my decision to use Webflow by replying to the newsletter. What is your opinion on choosing a tech stack for startups? I am eager to learn other perspectives! </p>

It got me worried. </span></div>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Marketing on Twitter, IndieHackers, and HackerNews helped a little, but it also brought down my productivity; hence yesterday’s newsletter subject “<a href="https://wentin.substack.com/p/fighting-unproductiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fighting Unproductivities</a>.” I need to brainstorm new strategies to growth-hack. I started by listing my unique advantages and disadvantages. </p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Disadvantage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Low Twitter engagement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have 3,700 followers, accumulated over five years via passion projects – I launched each project with a link to my Twitter profile. However, I rarely tweeted; my tweet count is lower than some accounts with three months of history. I failed to create engaging tweets to keep followers interested. Now I have suddenly become actively promoting my content on Twitter, but the engagement is low. </p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> I should not growth-hack on Twitter. Instead, I should create original non-self-promo tweets to get back on track first.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Advantage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I own a few popular sites</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I did right over the years was passion projects. I have a few project sites with consistent visitor streams. </p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> maybe some of the visitors could be interested in my recent work? I can add a modal to these sites that lead visitors to my latest work.</p>
<p>I took a look at google analytics to see which site is the most popular. The most popular sites that I own are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cssicon.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cssicon.space</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="play.typedetail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play.typedetail.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://typedetail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typedetail.com</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started to design the modal pop-up interaction. My favorite place to get inspiration for interactive animation is <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codrops</a>. This is what I ended up with after experimenting with a few different options:</p>

                <p>Last week was eventful and, based on one’s stock portfolio, painful. Over the years that I worked at Adobe, I bought into the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/uzvnbm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADBE</a> stock through labor (RSU) and money (ESPP). A big portion of my net worth is held in ADBE stock, and that stock sunk 20% on a single day — the day they announced Adobe would acquire Figma for $20 billion. </p>
<p>This newsletter series started on Aug 2nd, 2021, days after I left my position at the Adobe. Prior to founding <a href="https://typogram.co/">Typogram</a>, I spent a year and a half working on <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe XD</a> and five years on another Adobe acquisition Typekit (now called <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Fonts</a>). I felt the blow on multiple levels. One that I was once devoted to Adobe XD, spending days and nights trying to win the battle with Figma, but now the acquisition announces Adobe XD’s premature defeat. One that I mentioned earlier — the blow in my wallet.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">$20 billion is four times over-priced</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with the wallet blow. Not every investor of ADBE stock is like me, who held a grudge because they worked on the internal competitor product. Why do other investors hate the acquisition, as shown by the stock price plunge? The simple answer is that the $20 billion price tag is too expensive.</p>
<p>Startup evaluation is complex, but there are shortcuts we can take to do a rough estimate. We can try to estimate in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Figma last raised funds at a valuation of $10 billion in June 2021. At first glance, it might make sense: Figma is doing so well that it doubled its valuation in a year of time between 2021 and 2022. Except 2021 is at the peak of startup valuation, most startups cut their valuation by a lot in 2022, including those doing well. Taking Canva, another contender in the design space, for example, its valuation declined from $40 billion in 2021 to $26 billion in 2022, despite that they are doing well. Apply the same ratio to Figma, the Figma 2022 valuation is estimated to be <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way to peek at a startup’s valuation is by revenue and growth multiplier. High-growth startups may have a high multiplier like 10x. Figma is targeted to hit $400 million in revenue, assuming it has already hit the target revenue, multiple by a high multiplier of 10x — its valuation is at <strong>$4 billion</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the actual value of Figma is around <strong>$5 billion</strong>. $20 billion would be four times overpriced; hence investors dropped the stock on the heel of the acquisition announcement. Nobody likes a bad deal. To reach such a deal, it must be Adobe begged to acquire Figma; it was not a level field negotiation. Why does Adobe need Figma so badly?</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Organization chart oddity</h2>
<p>Reading Figma’s CEO’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> announcement, after the acquisition, he will report to David Wadhwani, not Scott Belsky, which stands out as odd to me. Scott Belsky is the person in charge of Creative Cloud. You may see him in every Adobe Max keynote talking about Creative Cloud products. After the acquisition announcement, the “design Twitter” jokingly mocked up Figma’s app icon in Creative Cloud form — it was transparent to everyone that Figma would be part of Creative Cloud; then why does the Figma CEO not report to the head of Creative Cloud?</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e1ff16-07b9-4384-9c05-550563b1c66a_1587x1080.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe"><figcaption>Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe</figcaption></figure>
<p>The answer, I now speculate as an outsider, is that David Wadhwani is the one who led and pushed through the acquisition, not Scott Belsky; therefore, the new Figma org reports to him. </p>
<p>Adobe has invested heavily in Adobe XD, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/10/05/introducing-project-comet-a-new-tool-for-designing-and-prototyping-user-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first announced to public as Project Comet in Oct 2015, 7 years ago</a>. While it is surely not as popular as Figma, it is nothing less than a successful product, strengthening the Creative Cloud ecosystem. According to the <a href="https://uxtools.co/survey-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 design tools survey</a> (the latest, 2022 survey has yet to come out), Adobe XD is the 3rd most popular UI design tool and 2nd most popular UI prototyping tool. Compared to <a href="https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#ui-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 design tools survey</a>, Adobe XD is on the rise — it jumped from 3rd to 2nd place in UI prototyping category and shortened the gap between itself and 2nd place in the UI design category:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09679d21-7de2-48fc-b234-7a72678f6d89_1778x604.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co"><figcaption>Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a user, we may view products as 1 or 0 — if I don’t use it, it almost doesn’t exist. But the market is vast and diverse; you might be surprised how many companies are using Adobe XD over Figma. All this is to say: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adobe XD is a considerable investment; Adobe has worked on it for more than seven years; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adobe XD is rising, not failing</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figma not reporting to the head of Creative Cloud sends a bad signal to me, almost a red flag. Did a group of business people decide to buy Figma without any serious consideration of Adobe XD’s effort? Have the “decision makers” ever even opened Adobe XD before they come to the conclusion that Adobe must have Figma for $20 billion? For Adobe to either admit XD’s defeat and have Figma annex XD, or strategize upon having two similar products grow side by side, it should most certainly involve the team who spent 7+ years building Adobe’s equivalence of Figma. It would be ignorant not to consult with them and have a thorough analysis of what Adobe XD is lacking in comparison to Figma and how difficult is it to build the missing parts.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Conflict of interest</h2>
<p>Who is David Wadhwani, the person Figma is going to report to? I have never heard of this name while working at Adobe. A little further research shows he joined Adobe in June 2021, just over a year ago. His last position prior was Venture Partner at venture capital firm <a href="https://greylock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greylock</a>. In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwadhwani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwadhwani" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a>profile, he is still a partner at Greylock; unknown to me whether it is outdated information due to lack of updates. Greylock invested in Figma in Series A, B, C, D, and E! Figma Series A’s price was $0.2 per share; it 200x’ed at the acquisition deal. I think there is a conflict of interest for David to lead the acquisition of Figma in Adobe, if David is still working for Greylock or if he has personally invested in Figma. </p>

<p>For context, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/elon-musk-wins-shareholder-lawsuit-over-the-companys-2point6-billion-solarcity-acquisition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk got sued by shareholders</a> in a similar situation. Musk’s company Tesla acquired SolarCity, a company founded by Musk’s cousins and backed by Musk. However, Musk did win the lawsuit in the end. With the context in mind, I believe it is reasonable to raise the question about conflict of interest, while it needs more investigation to allege there is actual wrongdoing. </p>

<p>While there is nothing I look forward to in this transaction, the “forward-looking statements” disclaimer from Figma’s CEO is <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/#disclaimer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interesting read</a>, which I quote below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of the forward-looking statements we make in this communication involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: expected revenues, cost savings, synergies and other benefits from the proposed transaction, such as <strong>Adobe’s ability to enhance Creative Cloud by adding Figma’s collaboration-first product design capabilities and the effectiveness of Figma’s technology, might not be realized within the expected time frames or at all</strong> and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I painfully laugh at this disclaimer, for how true it might be. I think the best outcome for users is for Figma to remain largely the same. But even with Adobe keeping Figma as independent as it can be, it will develop and grow at a much slower pace since there will be no venture capital funds pouring in, and Adobe’s resources drained to pay off the acquisition cost. The only winner is Figma investors. This acquisition is a lose-lose-lose situation for Adobe, Figma, and the design community. </p>
<p>With accelerated stock vesting triggered by the acquisition, a lot of Figma employees will jump ship to their next adventure. It is hard to blame them — they are rich now, so why not become angel investors or found their own company? That is the bright side of this acquisition — more competition is always better. Figma helped Adobe XD become better, and vice versa: “<a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-advanced-animations-with-smart-animate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Animate</a>” came from Adobe XD to Figma; “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JaQBWSB88w&amp;ab_channel=AdobeCreativeCloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Co-editing</a>” came from Figma to Adobe XD (Ah Yes, Adobe XD supports multi-player mode for three years now). I await to see what the design tool experts from Figma will bring to the world next.</p>

<p>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term “flow.” I understand it as a state of being ultra-focused and tireless, to the point of forgetting to eat or sleep.</p>
<p>As I enter startup life, working on my dream projects, I thought the flow state would frequently come to me. It turned out to be only half true. I find flow only happens with crafty activities, such as designing, coding, or writing. It never happens when I do self-promotion or marketing. Furthermore, on the days that I did both types of activities, I can’t get into the flow at all. In an attempt to fight my unproductiveness, I start to self-diagnose why.</p>
<p>To enter the state of flow, it needs a few hours of ramping up. The concentration level climbs up and then stays in the flow state at its peak, maintains it for a while, and then cools down. The graph:</p>

<p>On days I need to self-promote or do marketing, the design/code/writing activity is divided into several segments. Each segment doesn’t have enough time to climb up high enough to reach the flow state. The graph:</p>

<p>I started to notice the phenomenon while I was working at my corporate job. I have meetings each day that interrupt my design time, and because I was not able to enter the state of flow, I feel tired after work. The situation was improved when I started working for my startup, but as a founder, I need to pick tasks like marketing and sales. These new challenges become the new productivity killer.</p>
<p>I think it may help to dedicate days to marketing/self-promotion solely. If I have some extra time on those days, I can relax and browse the Internet to find inspirations or do market research. These activities seem to go together because they have similar attention patterns. On other days, I dedicate all day to design/code/write.</p>
