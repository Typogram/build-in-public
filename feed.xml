I am experiencing a sense of void after a highly productive period. It is not uncommon. For all my life, I am looking for the flow state.</span></div>

<p>Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term “flow.” I understand it as a state of being ultra-focused and tireless, to the point of forgetting to eat or sleep.</p>
<p>As I enter startup life, working on my dream projects, I thought the flow state would frequently come to me. It turned out to be only half true. I find flow only happens with crafty activities, such as designing, coding, or writing. It never happens when I do self-promotion or marketing. Furthermore, on the days that I did both types of activities, I can’t get into the flow at all. In an attempt to fight my unproductiveness, I start to self-diagnose why.</p>
<p>To enter the state of flow, it needs a few hours of ramping up. The concentration level climbs up and then stays in the flow state at its peak, maintains it for a while, and then cools down. The graph:</p>

<p>On days I need to self-promote or do marketing, the design/code/writing activity is divided into several segments. Each segment doesn’t have enough time to climb up high enough to reach the flow state. The graph:</p>

<p>I started to notice the phenomenon while I was working at my corporate job. I have meetings each day that interrupt my design time, and because I was not able to enter the state of flow, I feel tired after work. The situation was improved when I started working for my startup, but as a founder, I need to pick tasks like marketing and sales. These new challenges become the new productivity killer.</p>
<p>I think it may help to dedicate days to marketing/self-promotion solely. If I have some extra time on those days, I can relax and browse the Internet to find inspirations or do market research. These activities seem to go together because they have similar attention patterns. On other days, I dedicate all day to design/code/write.</p>

                    <img src="https://typogram.co/build/media/posts/17/Cover-2.png" alt="On Adobe Acquiring Figma" />
                <p>Last week was eventful and, based on one’s stock portfolio, painful. Over the years that I worked at Adobe, I bought into the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/uzvnbm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADBE</a> stock through labor (RSU) and money (ESPP). A big portion of my net worth is held in ADBE stock, and that stock sunk 20% on a single day — the day they announced Adobe would acquire Figma for $20 billion. </p>
<p>This newsletter series started on Aug 2nd, 2021, days after I left my position at the Adobe. Prior to founding <a href="https://typogram.co/">Typogram</a>, I spent a year and a half working on <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe XD</a> and five years on another Adobe acquisition Typekit (now called <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Fonts</a>). I felt the blow on multiple levels. One that I was once devoted to Adobe XD, spending days and nights trying to win the battle with Figma, but now the acquisition announces Adobe XD’s premature defeat. One that I mentioned earlier — the blow in my wallet.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">$20 billion is four times over-priced</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with the wallet blow. Not every investor of ADBE stock is like me, who held a grudge because they worked on the internal competitor product. Why do other investors hate the acquisition, as shown by the stock price plunge? The simple answer is that the $20 billion price tag is too expensive.</p>
<p>Startup evaluation is complex, but there are shortcuts we can take to do a rough estimate. We can try to estimate in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Figma last raised funds at a valuation of $10 billion in June 2021. At first glance, it might make sense: Figma is doing so well that it doubled its valuation in a year of time between 2021 and 2022. Except 2021 is at the peak of startup valuation, most startups cut their valuation by a lot in 2022, including those doing well. Taking Canva, another contender in the design space, for example, its valuation declined from $40 billion in 2021 to $26 billion in 2022, despite that they are doing well. Apply the same ratio to Figma, the Figma 2022 valuation is estimated to be <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way to peek at a startup’s valuation is by revenue and growth multiplier. High-growth startups may have a high multiplier like 10x. Figma is targeted to hit $400 million in revenue, assuming it has already hit the target revenue, multiple by a high multiplier of 10x — its valuation is at <strong>$4 billion</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the actual value of Figma is around <strong>$5 billion</strong>. $20 billion would be four times overpriced; hence investors dropped the stock on the heel of the acquisition announcement. Nobody likes a bad deal. To reach such a deal, it must be Adobe begged to acquire Figma; it was not a level field negotiation. Why does Adobe need Figma so badly?</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Organization chart oddity</h2>
<p>Reading Figma’s CEO’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> announcement, after the acquisition, he will report to David Wadhwani, not Scott Belsky, which stands out as odd to me. Scott Belsky is the person in charge of Creative Cloud. You may see him in every Adobe Max keynote talking about Creative Cloud products. After the acquisition announcement, the “design Twitter” jokingly mocked up Figma’s app icon in Creative Cloud form — it was transparent to everyone that Figma would be part of Creative Cloud; then why does the Figma CEO not report to the head of Creative Cloud?</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e1ff16-07b9-4384-9c05-550563b1c66a_1587x1080.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe"><figcaption>Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe</figcaption></figure>
<p>The answer, I now speculate as an outsider, is that David Wadhwani is the one who led and pushed through the acquisition, not Scott Belsky; therefore, the new Figma org reports to him. </p>
<p>Adobe has invested heavily in Adobe XD, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/10/05/introducing-project-comet-a-new-tool-for-designing-and-prototyping-user-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first announced to public as Project Comet in Oct 2015, 7 years ago</a>. While it is surely not as popular as Figma, it is nothing less than a successful product, strengthening the Creative Cloud ecosystem. According to the <a href="https://uxtools.co/survey-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 design tools survey</a> (the latest, 2022 survey has yet to come out), Adobe XD is the 3rd most popular UI design tool and 2nd most popular UI prototyping tool. Compared to <a href="https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#ui-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 design tools survey</a>, Adobe XD is on the rise — it jumped from 3rd to 2nd place in UI prototyping category and shortened the gap between itself and 2nd place in the UI design category:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09679d21-7de2-48fc-b234-7a72678f6d89_1778x604.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co"><figcaption>Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a user, we may view products as 1 or 0 — if I don’t use it, it almost doesn’t exist. But the market is vast and diverse; you might be surprised how many companies are using Adobe XD over Figma. All this is to say: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adobe XD is a considerable investment; Adobe has worked on it for more than seven years; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adobe XD is rising, not failing</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figma not reporting to the head of Creative Cloud sends a bad signal to me, almost a red flag. Did a group of business people decide to buy Figma without any serious consideration of Adobe XD’s effort? Have the “decision makers” ever even opened Adobe XD before they come to the conclusion that Adobe must have Figma for $20 billion? For Adobe to either admit XD’s defeat and have Figma annex XD, or strategize upon having two similar products grow side by side, it should most certainly involve the team who spent 7+ years building Adobe’s equivalence of Figma. It would be ignorant not to consult with them and have a thorough analysis of what Adobe XD is lacking in comparison to Figma and how difficult is it to build the missing parts.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Conflict of interest</h2>
<p>Who is David Wadhwani, the person Figma is going to report to? I have never heard of this name while working at Adobe. A little further research shows he joined Adobe in June 2021, just over a year ago. His last position prior was Venture Partner at venture capital firm <a href="https://greylock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greylock</a>. In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwadhwani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwadhwani" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a>profile, he is still a partner at Greylock; unknown to me whether it is outdated information due to lack of updates. Greylock invested in Figma in Series A, B, C, D, and E! Figma Series A’s price was $0.2 per share; it 200x’ed at the acquisition deal. I think there is a conflict of interest for David to lead the acquisition of Figma in Adobe, if David is still working for Greylock or if he has personally invested in Figma. </p>

<p>For context, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/elon-musk-wins-shareholder-lawsuit-over-the-companys-2point6-billion-solarcity-acquisition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk got sued by shareholders</a> in a similar situation. Musk’s company Tesla acquired SolarCity, a company founded by Musk’s cousins and backed by Musk. However, Musk did win the lawsuit in the end. With the context in mind, I believe it is reasonable to raise the question about conflict of interest, while it needs more investigation to allege there is actual wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Each of the forward-looking statements we make in this communication involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: expected revenues, cost savings, synergies and other benefits from the proposed transaction, such as <strong>Adobe’s ability to enhance Creative Cloud by adding Figma’s collaboration-first product design capabilities and the effectiveness of Figma’s technology, might not be realized within the expected time frames or at all</strong> and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I painfully laugh at this disclaimer, for how true it might be. I think the best outcome for users is for Figma to remain largely the same. But even with Adobe keeping Figma as independent as it can be, it will develop and grow at a much slower pace since there will be no venture capital funds pouring in, and Adobe’s resources drained to pay off the acquisition cost. The only winner is Figma investors. This acquisition is a lose-lose-lose situation for Adobe, Figma, and the design community. </p>
<p>With accelerated stock vesting triggered by the acquisition, a lot of Figma employees will jump ship to their next adventure. It is hard to blame them — they are rich now, so why not become angel investors or found their own company? That is the bright side of this acquisition — more competition is always better. Figma helped Adobe XD become better, and vice versa: “<a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-advanced-animations-with-smart-animate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Animate</a>” came from Adobe XD to Figma; “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JaQBWSB88w&amp;ab_channel=AdobeCreativeCloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Co-editing</a>” came from Figma to Adobe XD (Ah Yes, Adobe XD supports multi-player mode for three years now). I await to see what the design tool experts from Figma will bring to the world next.</p>

<div class="image-link-expand"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Yesterday, which is a Sunday, was a rather eventful day. It is a day in history for apparent reasons, though I am here to document and summarize what happened in my small startup life. We launched our first product on </span><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brand-personality-workshop-kit" rel="" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Product Hunt</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">! There is a lot of learning that I can share with you from the launch.</span></div>
</div>
</figure>
</div>
<h4 class="header-with-anchor-widget">How does Product Hunt work?</h4>
<p>Product hunt operates on a 24-hour interval. The clock resets at 00:00 pacific time (3 am in New York, where I live). All launched products during the 24 hours will show up under the Newest tab. The highest-voted product will show up in the Popular tab, which is the default tab that brings massive traffic. A note-worthy rule is that every product shares the same 24-hour interval. If your product is launched at 23:59 pacific time, it only has 1 minute of exposure.</p>
<h4 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Lesson 1: Launch with a global mindset.</h4>
<p>My original idea was to launch in the morning. I assumed people that I can reach is in a similar timezone as I am. I should promote during my daytime when my audience is active on Twitter or checking their Emails. Launching at 3 am is very counter-intuitive for me. I honestly forget the 3 am in New York would be 9 am somewhere else in the world. I should have had a global mindset when I planned for launch. The cryptocurrency market never closes, so is launching a product.</p>
<h4 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Lesson 2: Product Hunt is not a great place to get paying customers.</h4>
<p>While producthunt can brings traffic, it doesn’t convert to paying customers. Its visitors are not in the shopping mindset. They are in a discovery or research mindset. While I had sales through producthunt, it all came from direct audiences of my cofounder’s or mine. It didn’t help that my product was the only two that require payment on that day. The majority of launched products are free or offers a free tier. It is better to offer a free option and use producthunt as a channel to get exposure rather than paying customers.</p>
<h4 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Lesson 3: Product Hunt weighs “authentic” upvotes more than friends and family votes.</h4>
<p>Our product got 34 upvotes in total but didn’t get to the popular tab, while products with fewer votes did. I think that is due to the ranking algorithm. Votes from accounts with a long history are weighed more, while votes from freshly-opened accounts are weighed less or even penalized. If you are planning a producthunt launch, I suggest reaching out to a few producthunt users with a long history and securing their vote upfront to get your product on the Popular tab.</p>

</div>
<p>I think this is a good learning experience. I was very fearful to launch on producthunt before because I was overthinking it. This experience debunks many misperceptions about launching on producthunt and gives me some ideas of how to run a successful launch. I need to learn by practicing, be it making sales or launching a product on an unfamiliar platform.</p>

<div class="image-link-expand"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Firstly I would like to apologize for today’s title: it is a dumb joke; a parody of the famous startup bible: “Fail Fast, Fail Often: How Losing Can Help You Win,” obviously made up by a person with IQ on the lower end - me.</span></div>
</div>
</figure>
</div>
<p>On a serious note, I agree with “fail fast, fail often.” However, surprisingly, it is not easy to fail fast, let alone often.</p>
<p>For starters, you need to launch something first to fail fast. Launching a product could take forever. The perfectionist may get the better of you. Instead of MVP, before you know it, you are choosing the perfect tech stack, executing the perfect feature set, grinding the perfect UI/UX, refactoring to write the perfect code. Why? Because anything less is not good enough to represent you, not good enough to have your name signed to it. Your pride gets the better of you.</p>
<p>Secondly, you need to have a definition of failure to fail fast. I did many passion projects before, and there is no definition of failure for a passion project. Getting a Twitter follower is a win for me; having 100 site visitors is a win for me. It is impossible to fail a passion project. The root problem is that you are not asking much in return for your effort. Taking to step forward to “ask” is difficult because you may fail and get rejected, especially to ask for money. Your pride gets the better of you, again.</p>
<p>I launched a product today! I used Notion as a #NoCode tool to develop the minimum viable feature set. Notion is not the perfect tech stack, but it offers many advantages, such as built-in live collaborations.</p>
<p>I charge money for it! It is priced at $10. I am running a sale with a coupon code “limitedsale” to offer $9 off for a limited time.</p>
<p>It is my first time selling. I want to see what works and what doesn’t. One thing I know for sure: designing helped me get better at design; selling will help me get at making sales! I want to sell and learn as much as possible in the process.

                    <img src="https://typogram.co/build/media/posts/23/Cover-Image-2.png" alt="how to make money while you sleep" />
                <p>This morning I woke up to some Gumroad emails that I made several sales from the <a href="https://wentin.gumroad.com/l/brand-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brand personality workshop kit</a>. It gives me tremendous encouragement. Two-thirds of the sales came from the newsletter readers, you! I can’t say how much I appreciate it; it means a lot to me, thank you!</p>
<p>That gives me a significant mental shift. I have made money via my passion projects, primarily by publishing ads on my sites, but never by charging for the project itself. It gives me confirmation that this route could work. I need to work harder, finding more pain points and good solutions to address them, and that is all!</p>
<p>A few of my readers have written to me expressing they will be joining me on a similar path. I want to share a few quotes that clicked with me while I was making the hard decisions. Maybe they can bring you courage too, and make the decision less scary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of the business—to gain your financial freedom.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote clicked with me at “renting out your time.” It is not the prettiest way to describe employment, but there is some truth to it. I think passion plays a significant role in this: if employment is the only way to do the work you are passionate about, then forget about the whole renting out your time thing. You would spend the time doing it nevertheless. But if you have itches that are outside of your work, and you would prefer to spend time on them even when not being paid, then maybe the phrase will start to hit you the same way it hit me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you don’t build your dreams, then someone else will hire you to build theirs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote clicked with me at “building someone else’s dream.” I think working in big corporate, the dreamer often is too rich that I wouldn’t care to help build their dream, like Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos thanked all Amazon employees for paying for his outer space ride. Exactly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fact: There are three types of income: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>earned income (e.g., W2 salary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>business income (e.g., startup company)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investment income (e.g., stocks)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Earned income is the most taxed income in the United States (and maybe elsewhere too). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fact is why wealthy people pay fewer taxes; they have little to no earned income. It shocked me when I first learned this, and I started sharing it with people around me. It turned out that most people didn’t know that either. I don’t think it is fair, but what can I do other than diversify my income to the other two types?</p>

<p>These are the images for the Brand Personality Workshop Kit sales page. When I kicked off today’s work, I started by looking at marketing design examples. A few trends I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Colorful, highly saturated colors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate photography or 3D objects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I discovered that a prettified version of a real-life scene is more marketable than a pure 2D digital style. That made sense! In a digital product marketplace, everything is digital inherently; digital style doesn’t draw attention anymore. I see a lot of people are calling back the old-school “software in a box” to their digital product marketing, for example:</p>

<p>I teach design at the School of Visual Arts in New York. In one of my classes, I tell students always to be aware of trends, to serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>avoid the trend when needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>follow the trend when needed</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Today is one of the situations that I have decided to follow the trend. I am designing to please the eyes of site visitors. No, there is no shame in that! Design is to solve a problem. Today the problem is how do I grab people’s attention in a busy marketplace, so they would stop and look at what I am offering. The solution I found is “Design to Please.”</p>
<p>Designers should develop their styles, and I do have a style preference, shown in the work I linked in the first paragraph. But it doesn’t hurt to do something else when the problem needs me to. It was an enjoyable break from the style I am familiar with.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I got some great tips and advice! Thank you! Let me know what you think of the graphics I designed by replying to the email. Is there any way I can improve them before launching the product page? Is it clear that I am selling a brand personality workshop kit in the form of printable PDF and Notion templates?</p>

I got a proof of concept working, but the product is not launched yet. I put in more work over the past few days to make it more user-friendly and of higher production quality because I have an ambitious goal: selling it for $1!</span></div>
</div>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I shared a few screencasts for the workshop kit on the <a href="https://startup.wentin.net/The-Rule-of-99-Effort-5157bdad843c41e68f3fbf1f735dfa65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. The newsletter format won't allow me to embed videos. </p>
<p>I was initially planning to launch the Notion workshop kit today. I want to put it out in the world to see the responses: is there an appetite from startup founders to workshop their brand this way? I am eager to see. However, a new problem comes up: marketing.</p>
<p>I took a look at Gumroad and search for Notion Templates. There is more work: I need to put together a good marketing page! I check out some competitions; every product is presented with a well-written sales pitch and a detailed description of what buyers will get. Then it hits me: I never did this part before. I usually offer things for free, and I would just share the link with the world. Whoever needs it will take it. But selling things are different; even for $1, the game is fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>I could hush together a few paragraphs to put it on Gumroad, so I can check the checkbox of launching a product today. I decided against it. I thought of how many people will see the product page vs. how many people will see this Notion workshop kit I made; the ratio is probably 100:1! For every 100 people who visited the product page, only the few who paid $1 will see the Notion workshop kit. I have spent almost a week on the workshop kit. Do I really want to under-represent my effort? The disproportional effort I put on the 1% won’t be worth it if I don’t work hard for the 99%.</p>
<p>That is the lesson I learned today. I need to know how to sell! I can’t put 99% of my effort into something that only 1% of site visitors will see and 1% of effort into something 99% of visitors will see. It is disproportion. </p>
<p>The journey continues! Thanks for tuning in! If you like my content, be sure to sign up for this newsletter.</p>

<p>The #30DaysOfStartingUp project has been motivating. Every night I feel accomplished going to bed, and every morning I wake up to stats I want to check immediately. The feeling is a familiar one - I was like this when I did passion projects. Stats kidnap me!</p>
<p>The stats are different from what I am used to with passion projects, though! It is much harder to get people’s attention with a startup than with free passion projects. I had project launches with 20,000 visitors on launch day and got on hacker news's front page.</p>

<p>My old self would dread seeing this. However, my entrepreneur self looked at it from a different perspective. I learned my first lesson: passion projects are a short game; most of my projects reach their peak on launch day. Startup is a long game. We never want the peak to come.</p>
<p>Instead, I found encouragement in a different set of stats: the open rate is consistently above 40%. As long as I am putting in good work every day, my dear readers, you, come back to see my content and progress. That is the second lesson I learned: Persistency and consistency work.</p>

<p>I am sure there is still overnight success stories out there for startups, for example, Clubhouse. However, personally, I am not tuned into any clubhouse rooms anymore. What remains are the true fans. Overnight success certainly doesn’t hurt, but it is far from being necessary.</p>
<p>I was originally only planning to write the newsletter daily for 30 days. Now I have a bigger plan after 30 days: I will switch to biweekly and keep it running as long as the startup is open.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">#NoCode and #LowCode movement are the Industrial Revolution for tech. I know how to code but would still prefer writing less code if possible. Who doesn’t love doing less work as long as we get to the same destination - launching products?</p>
<p>I shared my cofounder Hua’s <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="Brand Personality Workshop Kit" rel="nofollow">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</a> two days ago and got a lot of interest from my readers. Crafting the workshop props was a source of fun for me, but I want to make it easier for other people to host the workshop, especially online.</p>
<p>One of the key ideas of the workshop kit is the three-sided personality card. Hua designed a genius way to fold the card so that we can easily flip to three different sides as the workshop progresses from step 1 to step 3:</p>

<p>Today is my 4th day, and I am in the process of onboarding to my new role. “Onboarding” is what my cofounder Hua calls it, and I do need it! Startups are different from passion projects. Passion projects are fueled by passion. Startups are fueled by passion and “more.”</p>
<p>On my first day, I wrote a piece about why I quit my cushy tech job to pursue my own thing. The post got a lot of comments on IndieHackers. I often get asked why I don’t stay at my job and run it as a side hustle. It is a fair question; my mom asked me this too.</p>
<p>Avoiding conflict of interest is one of the reasons. I want to run an ethical business. I can imagine it to work for some jobs, but as far as I know, most tech job doesn’t by default allow it. You need to submit a form to get the employer’s approval to run a side business.</p>
<p>Another reason is that I am not underestimating the difficulty of running a startup. I had past success running passion projects. I got media exposure, the Adobe offer, and invitations to give talks because of passion projects. But it doesn’t translate to startup success.</p>
<p>Startup comes with challenges that are not fun, but you are not allowed to move on. If a passion project stops being fun, I will move on to the next fun project. In fact, I recommend that you move on! The project that is burning the most passion will be the most successful one.</p>
<p>No-fun challenges will consume the most energy! Passion projects give energy back, and that is why I do them! But not-so-fun challenges consume me, and it is not about the time. Something could take minutes to do but hours or days of energy to recover from it.</p>
<p>If I run a startup like the way I run passion projects, I am bound to fail. I am fully anticipating the challenges and willing to devote energy to them to make it work. I am not saying everyone has to quit their job to run a startup, but I believe that I do.</p>
<p>Progress update: today, I am exploring using Notion as a #nocode platform to make Hua’s workshop kit more friendly to run online digitally. I shared about how to run that workshop with arts and crafts home-made workshop props yesterday; check it out if you missed it here.</p>
<p>I will share more about the Notion version tomorrow. If you know some Notion geek friends, please share my newsletter so we can make friends.</p>
